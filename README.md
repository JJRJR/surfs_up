# SurfsUp_Challenge

## Overview

W. Avy needed more temperature information about the weather trends specifically in the months of June and December. He needs this information to determine if his surf and ice cream shop is sustainable all year long. We did this by importing the data into classes that we could query. Then we wrote two queries that specifically gave us the temperatures for the months of June and December. Once we had the data organized we were able easily to identify the weather trends for both months.

## Results

- Although the average temperature is lower in December than in June, the difference is minimal. 
- There were over 1,000 more observations in December than in June.
- The maximum temperature for both months is identical however the minimum temperature would be noticeably lower in December.

## Summary

After analysis, we can conclude that the weather is maintained well enough in both months to sustain the business. I would continue to query each month to make sure to identify any months that could become a problem. I would also combine the temperature data with the perception data to identify months that could slow business down and months where we could see a spike in traffic. I would also drill down to see which station is providing the most optimal weather data as well. This could help when planning where to place locations.
